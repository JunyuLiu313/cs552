// Write your answer to Problem 1 (b) here

For p1-1.asm:
Between line 9 and 10, we encounter the MEM-to-EX forwarding in r3.
The forwarding takes place because we have a andn instruction after the laod instruction. And Rd in load instruction is the same as Rt in andn instruction.

p1-2.asm:
We test EX-to-EX forwarding multiple times from line 9 to 15.
Forwarding occurs becuase andn instructions are followed by other andn instructions.
The following andn instruction's Rt is the same as Rd of previous instruction.

p1-3.asm:
We test EX-to-MEM forwarding occurs between instructions in line 10 and line 11.
EX-to-MEM occurs on r4 because there is a store word instr. followed by an ANDN instr.
